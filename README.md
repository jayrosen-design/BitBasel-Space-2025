## üåï BitBasel Space Program & Lunar Archival

In partnership with **Polkadot**, BitBasel‚Äôs **Art for Impact Space Program** is sending the first **UN-themed art collection to the Moon**‚Äîa cultural milestone in both art history and space exploration.

This historic mission preserves humanity‚Äôs creative expression through the **Galactic Library Preserve Humanity (GLPH)** archive. Selected artworks, including *New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions* by Jay Rosen, will be permanently housed on the Moon‚Äôs surface aboard **Astrobotic‚Äôs Griffin-1 lander**, as part of **NASA‚Äôs CLPS program**. Protected by **Nanofiche archival technology**, these works are engineered to endure the Moon‚Äôs harsh environment for millennia.

As a global first, artists were invited to submit works interpreting the **UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. A prestigious committee‚Äîfeaturing experts from BitBasel, Polkadot, GLPH, and the **University of Florida Blockchain Lab**‚Äîselected pieces based on both artistic merit and SDG alignment.

This artwork was officially selected and will be launched via **SpaceX in late 2025**, ensuring that its vision of education, conservation, and innovation is etched into the cultural legacy of space.

> ‚ÄúBy preserving SDG-inspired art on the Moon, we affirm our commitment to global progress‚Äîacross borders, and beyond planets.‚Äù

## üåï Lunar Archival

In 2025, this artwork was selected to be **digitally preserved aboard the Griffin-1 Lunar Lander** as part of the **BitBasel Space Program** and **AstroGLPH lunar archive**.  

It is a declaration that literacy, imagination, and ocean conservation are universal values‚Äîworthy of preservation not just on Earth, but **on the Moon**.

## üöÄ Artwork Overview

**New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions**, developed at the **University of Florida College of Education**, is an immersive educational initiative aimed at addressing literacy gaps among 3rd‚Äì5th grade students. Designed to complement the **New Worlds Reading Initiative**, the project provides **free books shipped to homes**, and pairs them with **augmented reality (AR) mini-games** that reinforce vocabulary, reading confidence, and curiosity.

This project is made possible through a collaboration with the **UF Lastinger Center for Learning**, **Scholastic**, and the **Florida Department of Education**.

The first themed experience, **Ocean AR**, focuses on Florida's marine ecology and conservation. In the *Bubble Pop* game:

- Students scan floating AR bubbles using tablets  
- Prompts reveal life-scale models of **whales**, **dolphins**, **clownfish**, **octopuses**, and more  
- Gameplay reinforces vocabulary, comprehension, and ecological awareness  

> _"Imagine reading about the ocean‚Äîthen seeing a blue whale breach above your desk."_  
This magical experience bridges literacy with environmental stewardship.
