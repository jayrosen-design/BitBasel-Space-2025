## üåï BitBasel Space Program & Lunar Archival

In partnership with **Polkadot**, BitBasel‚Äôs **Art for Impact Space Program** is sending the first **UN-themed art collection to the Moon**‚Äîa cultural milestone in both art history and space exploration.

This historic mission preserves humanity‚Äôs creative expression through the **Galactic Library Preserve Humanity (GLPH)** archive. Selected artworks, including *New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions* by Jay Rosen, will be permanently housed on the Moon‚Äôs surface aboard **Astrobotic‚Äôs Griffin-1 lander**, as part of **NASA‚Äôs CLPS program**. Protected by **Nanofiche archival technology**, these works are engineered to endure the Moon‚Äôs harsh environment for millennia.

As a global first, artists were invited to submit works interpreting the **UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. A prestigious committee‚Äîfeaturing experts from BitBasel, Polkadot, GLPH, and the **University of Florida Blockchain Lab**‚Äîselected pieces based on both artistic merit and SDG alignment.

This artwork was officially selected and will be launched via **SpaceX in late 2025**, ensuring that its vision of education, conservation, and innovation is etched into the cultural legacy of space.

## üöÄ Artwork Overview

**New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions**, developed at the **University of Florida College of Education**, addresses literacy gaps for 3rd‚Äì5th graders who are falling behind. Bundled with the **New Worlds Reading Initiative**, it provides free books delivered directly to students‚Äô homes via a collaboration with the **UF Lastinger Center for Learning** and **Scholastic**. 

Inspired by Scholastic classics like "The Magic School Bus" and "Whale vs. Giant Squid", our team crafted immersive AR mini-games tied to each book‚Äôs subject matter‚Äîstrengthening vocabulary, building reading confidence, and fostering a lifelong love of learning.

Ocean AR is the first themed expedition, centered on Florida ecology and marine conservation. In the "Bubble Pop" game, as this concept art illustrates, students point their tablets at floating bubbles to match prompts and reveal life-scale models of whales, sea turtles, clownfish, jellyfish, and more. 

By blending physical books with digital ecosystems, the experience sparks genuine curiosity - imagine reading about the ocean, then seeing a blue whale breach above your desk. This visceral connection cements both literary comprehension and environmental stewardship.
