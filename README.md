## 🌕 Lunar Archival

In 2025, this artwork was selected to be **digitally preserved aboard the Griffin-1 Lunar Lander** as part of the **BitBasel Space Program** and **AstroGLPH lunar archive**.  

It is a declaration that literacy, imagination, and ocean conservation are universal values—worthy of preservation not just on Earth, but **on the Moon**.

## 🚀 Artwork Overview

**New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions**, developed at the **University of Florida College of Education**, is an immersive educational initiative aimed at addressing literacy gaps among 3rd–5th grade students. Designed to complement the **New Worlds Reading Initiative**, the project provides **free books shipped to homes**, and pairs them with **augmented reality (AR) mini-games** that reinforce vocabulary, reading confidence, and curiosity.

This project is made possible through a collaboration with the **UF Lastinger Center for Learning**, **Scholastic**, and the **Florida Department of Education**.


The first themed experience, **Ocean AR**, focuses on Florida's marine ecology and conservation. In the *Bubble Pop* game:

- Students scan floating AR bubbles using tablets  
- Prompts reveal life-scale models of **whales**, **dolphins**, **clownfish**, **octopuses**, and more  
- Gameplay reinforces vocabulary, comprehension, and ecological awareness  

> _"Imagine reading about the ocean—then seeing a blue whale breach above your desk."_  
This magical experience bridges literacy with environmental stewardship.
